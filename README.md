# Sorting Visualiser

A C++ unit at university I was doing gave me the task of writing a sorting visualiser using the Bubble Sort algorithm. 
This was my first time touching C++, and to my surprise, I had managed to make a sorting visualiser that compiled 
without warning. Though, it lacked a visual aspect along with user interaction. So I decided to build it again in a language
that I use nearly everyday, JavaScript.
